				<dt>Theory and Evidence</dt>
					<dd className="ml-3">- A good theory is neccessary to ensure that we can describe and address the factors that cause health problems and methods to achieve change.</dd>
		            <dd className="ml-3">- Contirbution to theory is good but it is peripheral to the problem solving.</dd>
		            <dd className="ml-3">- Understanding a problem begins with questions about a specific health or social problem. It is followed by a review of available social and behavioral theories and research evidence for causations of the problem, and its behavioral and environmental contributors.</dd>
		            <dd className="ml-3">- There are causal and change theories.</dd>
		            <dd className="ml-3">- After selecting the appropriate theories, we continue by gathering evidence, including data and opinions and experiences of community memebers and experts.</dd>
                <dt>Ecological Models and System Thinking</dt>
                <dd className="ml-3">- In the social ecological model, health is a function of the individual and the environment in which the individual live, including family, social network, organization, communities, and sociaties.</dd>
                <dd className="ml-3">- A system is activities, actors, and settings that are affected by or affect a certain problem situation.</dd>
                <dd className="ml-3">- Interventions are events in systems and other factors within a system can reinforce or dampen the influence of an intervention.</dd>
                <dd className="ml-3">- Ecological Levels:</dd>
